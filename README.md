# Joke Factory Project Server
The Joke Factory project is a simple platform for users to share and read jokes. Users can submit their own jokes, review existing jokes, and leave comments.

This is the backend for the project.

This projects serves as my practice to learn about Test-Driven Development (TDD) in TypeScript. Through TDD, I'm practicing to produce clean code by regularly refactoring my codebase. 

## Getting Started 

- Test: 
  - Running all the test one by one `npm run test:inband`
  - Running One file test and re-run the test after saving the files `npm run test:one:watch`
- Running the development server: 
  - `npm run prestart` Then `npm run start:server`

## Current Status
Working In Progress

## Main Technologies Used
This project is built using the following technologies:
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sqlite3 (for test and development)
- PostgreSQL (for production)
